Hello all this is the complete end to end blinkit sales analysis dashboard prepared using power BI
here are the objectives and insights of project 
Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze the sales performance of BlinkIT's outlets across different categories, locations, and product attributes. The goal is to identify key factors that contribute to sales, understand customer preferences, and make data-driven decisions to improve sales strategies. The dashboard visualizes the overall performance metrics, helping stakeholders quickly grasp critical insights and trends.

Insights:
Sales Distribution:

High Sales in Supermarket Type1: Supermarket Type1 outlets contribute the highest sales, indicating their popularity and possibly larger customer base compared to other outlet types.
Low Fat vs. Regular: Regular items contribute a larger portion of sales, but Low Fat items also have a significant share, showing a market for health-conscious consumers.
Outlet Location:

Tier 3 Locations: Tier 3 outlets outperform Tier 1 and Tier 2 in terms of sales. This might suggest higher demand or less competition in these areas.
Item Categories:

Fruits and Vegetables & Snack Foods: These categories lead in sales, indicating consumer preference for fresh produce and snacks. These are likely high-frequency purchase items.
Seafood and Breakfast: These categories have the lowest sales, which may indicate either a lack of demand or insufficient marketing efforts.
Outlet Size:

High Size Outlets Perform Better: High-sized outlets generate more revenue, suggesting that larger outlets can stock more items and cater to a broader customer base.
Sales Trends Over Time:

Peak in 2018: The sales peak in 2018 suggests a period of strong performance, followed by a slight decline. Understanding the factors behind this peak (e.g., marketing campaigns, new product launches) could help replicate similar success in the future.
Customer Ratings:

Moderate Average Rating (3.9): While the average rating is close to 4, there's room for improvement in customer satisfaction. This could be linked to the performance of specific outlets or product categories.
